Tower Defense game

Thank you for the opportunity. I had a lot of fun working on this project.
I missed some of the things (felt bad this weekend).

1) Selling a object.
2) Dynamic waves, and not static.

If you would like, I will be more than happy to complete this project, with all the small details that I missed from the document.
