Tower Defense game

Thank you for the opportunity i had a lot of fun working on this project.
I missed some of the things (i felt bad this weekened).

1) Selling a object.
2) Dynamic waves, and not static.

If you would like i will be more then happy to complete this project, with all the small details that i missed from the document.
